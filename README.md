# Compiler Theory Lexical Analyzer
Contains a school project to create a lexical analyzer using flex, bison, C++, and make. The aim of the course was to explore what actions the compiler takes during its various phases.

## Requirements
- Your favorite Linux distribution (I recommend Ubuntu for this project)
- Use `apt` or `yum` to get the packages for Flex, Bison, Make, and G++ (Use `sudo` to avoid permission issues)
- Create your desired directory for the files using `mkdir`
- Move source files to your chosen directory using `mv` or your personally prefered method
- Navigate to the directory with the source files and use `make` to compile the project
- Utilize the following syntax to run the program `./compile < test1.txt`

### Special Notes
- If you are modifying any of the files, you must run `make` to compile your new changes
- When modifying C++ files you must modify the corresponding header file
- Included test cases can be accessed via the **tests** folder in the repo
